# SpamSifter: Intelligent SMS Classification with Deep Learning
SpamSifter is an advanced machine learning project designed to classify SMS messages as either "ham" (normal) or "spam" (advertisements). By leveraging state-of-the-art text preprocessing techniques and a robust neural network, SpamSifter ensures accurate and reliable message classification.
# Key Highlights
1. **Balanced Dataset for Better Learning:**

     * Applied Random Undersampling to address class imbalance, ensuring the model learns effectively from both "ham" and "spam" messages.                                                                              
2. **Sophisticated Text Preprocessing**

     * Used Keras TextVectorization to transform raw SMS messages into structured numerical representations for seamless input to the neural network.
       Automatically handles tokenization, lowercasing, and vocabulary mapping.                                                    
3. **User-Friendly Prediction:**

     * The predict_message(message) function provides:
        1. A confidence score (0 to 1) indicating the likelihood of "spam."
        2. A clear label: "ham" or "spam," based on the prediction.                                                                 
# Workflow
